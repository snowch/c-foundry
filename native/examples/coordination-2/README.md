# Producer–consumer queues

Complete native example, ready to edit and run in Codespaces or locally.

## 36.2 Producer–consumer queues

A bounded producer–consumer queue turns overload into backpressure rather than unbounded memory growth.

This four-slot queue carries eight requests, so a producer may wait for space. Every successful enqueue has one corresponding dequeue, and close rejects later offers while allowing already queued work to drain. FIFO is defined by queue admission order, not by when producer threads started. The example uses one producer and consumer to make the basic contract easy to verify.

}
```

Output:

```text
capacity=4 exactly_once=8
```

More work than capacity completes because slots are reused after consumption. The verification checks count and sum for this known unique sequence.

**Watch for:** Count and sum alone are not a complete exactly-once proof for arbitrary inputs; production tests should track each request ID.

**Check:** What happens when the queue fills under this policy?

1. The oldest request is silently overwritten
2. The producer waits for space or closure

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

The producer waits for space or closure. Blocking admission preserves accepted work instead of dropping it.

</details>

**Try:** Track every request ID in a bitmap, then test multiple producers and repeated queue wraparound.
