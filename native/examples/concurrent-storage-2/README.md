## 38.2 A bounded work queue

A storage service should bound pending requests and define when ownership transfers from a caller to the queue.

The integer request fixture copies values into queue slots. Successful admission transfers the queued value, while rejected admission leaves the caller responsible for any external payload owner. For pointer-bearing requests, define whether enqueue borrows, clones, or takes ownership. A caller must not hold a storage lock while blocking on queue capacity if the consumer needs that lock.

Output:

```

All accepted copied requests are processed before shutdown completes. No mutable queue pointer escapes to callers.

**Watch for:** Passing pointers to short-lived request objects through a queue does not extend their lifetimes.

**Check:** What must be explicit for pointer-bearing requests?

1. Only the pointer’s numeric value
2. Ownership on successful and failed enqueue

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Ownership on successful and failed enqueue. The asynchronous consumer may run after the caller’s scope ends.

</details>

**Try:** Replace integer requests with owned command objects and verify cleanup on rejected enqueue and successful processing.
