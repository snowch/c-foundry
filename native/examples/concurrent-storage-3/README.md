## 38.3 A single writer processing requests

Single-writer ownership can replace fine-grained mutation locks with serialized request processing. Reads and acknowledgements still need an explicit protocol.

The consumer alone updates its sum while producers only submit copied deltas. main reads the final state after joining the consumer. A database version would execute validated requests in that owner and return copied responses through a completion mechanism; it must not hand callers raw pointers into mutable storage. Durable acknowledgement still depends on the log protocol, not queue admission.

Output:

```text
writer_state=36 processed=8
```

There is one writer of the aggregate state, and join establishes the final read boundary. The fixture models request ownership, not a network server.

**Watch for:** Enqueued does not mean executed, committed, or durable; those are distinct response stages.

**Check:** Does successful queue admission mean a transaction is durably committed?

1. No
2. Yes

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

No. The request has not necessarily been processed or synchronized to storage.

</details>

**Try:** Add per-request responses with separate accepted, executed, and durable statuses, and document their wait boundaries.
