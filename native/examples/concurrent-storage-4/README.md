## 38.4 Shutdown, cancellation, and concurrency testing

Shutdown must wake blocked participants and decide what happens to already accepted work. Cooperative closure is easier to reason about than abrupt cancellation.

The queue’s close flag rejects future puts and lets takes drain existing items before returning false. Both condition variables are broadcast so blocked producers and consumers recheck their predicates. All workers join before mutex and condition-variable destruction. The fixture repeats startup and shutdown to expose lifecycle mistakes without using scheduling sleeps.

Each run initializes fresh synchronization objects and destroys them only after both workers finish. This tests a useful subset of schedules, not every possible interleaving.

**Watch for:** pthread_cancel can require cleanup handlers for held resources; it is not a drop-in replacement for this cooperative close protocol.

**Check:** When may synchronization objects be destroyed?

1. As soon as close sets a flag
2. After every accessing worker has finished

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

After every accessing worker has finished. A woken or draining worker may still need the lock and conditions.

**Try:** Add repeated close, blocked admission, consumer failure, and per-ID exactly-once checks; run ThreadSanitizer where supported.
